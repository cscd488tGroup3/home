## Gardening Website

Our main purpose for creating this website is to assist individuals who would like
to start gardening but do not know where to begin, as well as those who already have a
garden and want to improve its quality and yield. We aim to make the website helpful by
providing easy access to helpful information and tips. It does not matter if someone is
starting from scratch, already has a garden, is a busy person, or manages cropsâ€”the
platform will help them find solutions easily and quickly.

## Features

In addition, our website will cater to diverse gardening needs. From specific tips
to tailored information based on location, climate, and more, users will be able to find
advice that suits their unique circumstances. Whether they have a small garden or a
larger space, the website will offer support regardless of their space, schedule, or
lifestyle. By incorporating these features, we hope users can help one another, learn
new things about gardening, and make the experience enjoyable and rewarding.

## Frameworks

Our website will be built using Astro and styled with Tailwind and DaisyUI. These frameworks allow for
fast, modular development. They are designed to handle repetitive structures and components, which will
allow our website to dynamically display gardening information that a user needs, as well as 
user generated content for the greater community.

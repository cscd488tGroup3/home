			<br />
			<p>My name is Daniel and I am originally from Prosser, Washington. I’m currently a Senior at Eastern Washington University, working toward my Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) with minors in Spanish, Communications, and Cybersecurity. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in software or web development, as that’s where I feel most confident and passionate.</p>
			<p>I’m a huge sports fan and love watching the Boston Celtics and San Francisco 49ers whenever their games are on. I also enjoy collecting sneakers, especially retro pairs of Jordans and Nikes, shoes have always been a passion of mine.</p>
			<p>When I’m not coding or working on projects, you’ll usually find me diving into my favorite hobbies, like playing video games, watching movies, or hanging out with friends. I’m always up for a good time, whether it’s on the court, in front of a screen, or just hanging with the people I care about.</p>
